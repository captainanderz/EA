<h2>Appendix A – The Software </h2>

<p>
    Endpoint Admin is a digital tool to help Customers to enable fluent application usage 
    by distributing new application versions in the software management suite Microsoft Endpoint Manager. 
    The service contains the Supported Applications (meaning applications which the Supplier 
    has included in the Software Manager Service), where application life-cycle can be fully 
    automated. In addition to these general Supported Applications, the Endpoint Admin can be 
    used to distribute also customer-specific applications packages (meaning application packages 
    modified especially for the specific Customer) that are used in the Customers organization. 
    The purpose of the Endpoint Admin is to automate frequently updated and lot of maintenance 
    required applications and to keep security at a high level, as specified in more detail in 
    the Service Description.
    
    Endpoint Admin provides a software repository, which is updated daily. Administrators and 
    companies can use this repository to deliver/deploy tested and approved packages in their 
    own software management suite and avoid spending time on creating their own application packages.  

    The application is hosted in the cloud as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and requires no 
    additional it-infrastructure to implement. However, the customer must supply their own 
    Microsoft Endpoint Manager. 

    The Customer acquires the right to use the product of service described in the Licens Agreement 
    executed between Customer and Supplier.
